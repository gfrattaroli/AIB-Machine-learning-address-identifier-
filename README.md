# Machine-learning-personal-info-identifier-
A machine-learning based approach on extracting address & personal information from an unstructured text field.

Automating information retrieval from unstructured text is a recurrent objective for data scientists and data mining projects. 
The postal address is probably the most common piece of information that can be extracted and anonymized according to business requirements.
This project proposes a machine-learning method for address identification. 

This system uses a word n-gram model and a Na√Øve-Bayes classifier to correctly assert the nature of a geo-located entity, extracts and anonymize it. 
The overall process resulted more accurate than a regular expression approach with a given accuracy rate of 98.7% and a recall rate of 82.4%.
